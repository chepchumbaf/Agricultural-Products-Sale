# Agricultural Products Sales Analysis – Power BI Project

## Project Overview

Agricultural economics plays an important role in understanding how agricultural resources are produced, distributed, and consumed within the global economy. Agriculture supports food security, employment, economic development, and international trade.

This project focuses on analyzing agricultural product sales data to understand market trends, demand patterns, and supply performance across different product categories.

The dataset contains sales, supply chain, and pricing information for agricultural products including Vegetables, Fruits, Grains, Dairy, and Livestock for the years 2022 and 2023.

The main goal of this project is to transform raw agricultural sales data into meaningful insights using Power BI to support decision-making and future sales prediction.
